## Principle of operation

The RF signal is digitized by a high-speed ADC chip and fed to an FPGA processor. <br>
It performs DDC / DUC conversion (digital frequency shift down or up the spectrum) - by analogy with a direct conversion receiver. <br>
The I and Q quadrature signals from the conversions are fed to the STM32 microprocessor. <br>
It filters, (de) modulates and outputs audio to an audio codec / USB. It also handles the entire user interface. <br>
When transmitting, the process occurs in the opposite order, only at the end of the chain there is a DAC, which converts the digital signal back to analog RF. <br>

## Build

I ordered the boards in the Chinese service JLCPCB, they and their schemes are in the Scheme folder. <br>
After assembly, you need to flash FPGA and STM32 chips. <br>
STM32 firmware is performed via Keil or via USB lanyard in DFU Mode (by STM32 / FLASH.bat script). Or via ST-LINK v2. You must hold down the power button while flashing. <br>
FPGA firmware is performed through the Quartus program using a USB-Blaster. <br>
A properly assembled device does not require debugging, but if problems arise, the first thing to do is to check for clock signals: <br>
90 FGPA pin and ADC clock input - 122.88 MHz, PC9 STM32 pin - 12.288 MHz, PB10 STM32 pin - 48 kHz. <br>
If necessary, calibrate the transceiver through the appropriate menu <br>
WiFi module ESP-01 must have fresh firmware with SDK 3.0.4 and higher, and AT commands 1.7.4 and higher <br>
Supported LCD: ILI9481, ILI9486, HX8357B, HX8357C, ST7796S, RA8875+GT911
